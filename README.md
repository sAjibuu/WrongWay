# About

**Wrongway** is a simple tool for bypassing Open Redirect restrictions, it aims to aid red teams, bug hunters and penetration testers to automate the tedious manual testing proccess of Open Redirect vulnerability with various techniques.

# Customisation

###
To add a new module, simply add a function with your desired functionality to modules.py then add the function by name into the list "active_modules" in config.py

# Download:
    https://github.com/sAjibuu/WrongWay.git

# Installation:

## ***Attention***

The program only works with request files generated by proxy tools, such as Burp Suite and ZAP OWASP.

Save the request file from the proxy tool you are using, for example, in Burp Suite, choose "Save Item" or "Copy to file".
